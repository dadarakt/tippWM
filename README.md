This project has the code for the data-retrieving and number-crunshing mechanism on the one hand and the code to run a webapp ontop of the data on the other hand.

A MySQL database is used to store the data and power the webapp, which calcutates things on the fly.
Data is automatically retrieved from http://openligadb.de to calculate the scores for all the players.
